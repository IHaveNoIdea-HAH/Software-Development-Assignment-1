# Risk 

- Lack of Coding Knowledge
  
Some people in this project may have different coding experience
Causing

- Testing

No amount of testing can make sure the final product will be bug free. Some things might be overlooked.

- Dependencies on libraries

The project requires API for making the game more unique and random
If not, then it will be set values.
Which may cause the user to become bored
