# Activity 1 ‚Äì Requirements and Creative Session

We've decided to re-arrange the tasks stated in the assignment brief for the Activity 1 in a more logical order to make it easier to work on them and split the work amongst us three.

--- 

## Task 1 ‚Äì Review all available projects before deciding which to develop

Project: Match.
Description: Match is where you are shown a set of items and must relate them into the related Categories
The core requirements are: Displaying items or clues. Drag and Drop system. Tracking score. 

Project: Jigsaw.
Description: Assemble pieces to make an image.
Core requirements: Image silcing into jigsaw. drag and drop system. Snap to place

Project: Crossword (Chosen)
Description: Solve a crossword grid by answering clues
Core requirements: Generating crossword grids. Generating clues. Filling letters and checking if they match

We've reviewed all 3 available projects to chose from and during the initial brainstorming session we've decided to go with the crossword game project.
We felt that the crossword game would be a good fit for our team as it combines word puzzles with a simple yet engaging gameplay mechanic.

---

## Task 2 ‚Äì Primary Target Audience

During the brainstorming session we've agreed that our crossword game targets **young adults aged 15‚Äì30**, mainly students and young professionals who enjoy short, word-based puzzles during study or work breaks.  
They prefer something quick, clean, and rewarding that helps improve vocabulary and overall erudition while relaxing.
This choice was made because this demographic is likely to appreciate the cognitive challenge of crosswords while also valuing a polished user experience that fits into their busy lifestyles.

---

## Task 4 ‚Äì User Profiles

We've created two user profiles representing our primary target audience:

### üë©‚Äçüíº Sophie (21)
- University student (Business & Marketing)
- Plays puzzle games to take breaks from studying.
- **Wants:** quick, engaging puzzles that fit into short breaks.
- **Needs:** fast-loading crossword, clear design, instant feedback.  
- **Frustrations:** Cluttered interface or slow response.

### üë®‚Äçüíª Aaron (27)

## Task 5 - High level user requirements

### High level user requirements
Based on target audience and user profiles, we've come up with the following preliminary high-level user requirements for our crossword game.
Depending on time available, some of these may be deprioritised to ensure we meet the deadline for our assignment.
The strict deadline means we have to focus on the core gameplay features first and polish those before adding any additional features.
Therefore, we identified some of the features to be the core ones and to comprise our minimum viable product (MVP) while the others are nice-to-have features that we may add if time permits and to generally represent Phase 2 features.

NOTE: Delete the things in the bracket in the future. For now do not delete it so we don't confuse ourselves.
If we have time, task to do:
2,4,6 (for now just random generated words), 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18
Ignore these task when creating the game, for now create the necessary stuff

MVP features (Must have):
1. Game has to have main menu 
2. Game has to have Game Win screen. (When a player correctly guesses all words)
3. Game has to have Game Over screen. (When a player runs out of guesses)
4. Player must be able to play new game.
5. Each new crossword game is going to use a set of random words from different topics.
6. Player must be able to score points when correct word is guessed. 
7. There has to be a HUD in the game showing current score, words guessed, words remaining to be guessed, guesses made etc.  
8. Gameboard should be rendered on screen with words hidden horizontally and vertically also numbered so a player knows what word they are guessing.
9. Player has to be able to select a word or a clue number corresponding to a word on the gameboard and enter an entire guess word and click ‚ÄòCheck‚Äô button to see if they guessed correctly.
10. There has to be a numbered list of clues displayed which contains all of the clues about words hidden on the crossword gameboard plus the their directions being across or down.
11. Player has to be able to uncover an entire word hidden on the gameboard. But this gives a penalty to the score.
12. Player has to be able to click a button to auto-solve the whole crossword but this gives penalty points for any unsolved clues.
13. Player has to be able to create an account and log in to the game so that their scores and progress can be saved.
14. Game has to have an intuitive user interface for navigating menus, starting new games, viewing scores etc.
15. Game has to have a simple scoring system where points are awarded for correct answers and penalties for hints or auto-solve.
16. The crossword puzzles should be dynamically generated using some sort of crossword generation algorithm.

Nice to have features (If time permits) so our Phase 2 features:
1. Difficulty levels. User can select from easy, medium, hard difficulty levels.
2. More advanced scoring logic like combo-bonuses, power-ups, streak bonuses??? Nice to have, low priority.
3. Accessibility features!: high contrast color scheme, fonts, links etc.
4. Game has to have leaderboard with 10 best players and their scores and times.
5. Game should have in-built game time which measures how much time a player spent on the game.
6. Player can be asked whether timer should be enabled or not.
7. Game has to be optimized for various screen sizes and devices (responsive design).
8. Progress saving: Player‚Äôs progress and scores are saved locally so that they can resume unfinished game later.

### Hardware Requirements

Players of our crossword game will need a device capable of running a web browser, such as a desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smartphone. 
The device should have a minimum of 2GB RAM and a modern processor to ensure smooth gameplay.
No fancy hardware such as GPU is required as the game is not graphically intensive.

### Operating System Requirements

The crossword game will be web-based and compatible with major operating systems including Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

### AI in the game

In our game we are not planning to use AI features as part of the core gameplay experience.
The only kind of 'AI' feature we are going to use is using an algorithm to generate crossword for a new game started by a user using random words from the vocabulary of clues.
For this we will use a predefined list of words and clues, and the algorithm would randomly select words from this list to create unique crossword puzzles for each game session played by a user.
So, this is going to be a basic implementation and does not involve advanced AI techniques.

## Task 3 - Create an overall specification 

Create an overall specification based on user and system requirements (including HCI, game/application-rules and the 
game/application-mechanics (e.g. what are the rules for the game, how will the game be controlled, how will 
any non-player characters interact, etc.) 

The following list of functional requirements has been produced to cover the high-level user requirements from task 5 above.
It has to be mentioned the list also has the acceptance criteria for each functional requirement to ensure that the requirement is testable and verifiable.

| Functional requirement             | Type | Specification                                                                                                                                                                                          | Acceptance Criteria                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Game win screen when the user wins | UI   | When a player correctly guesses all words, a Game Win screen is displayed.                                                                                                                             | When all words are guessed correctly, the Game Win screen appears with final game state e.g. score, count of guesses made etc. and option to return to main menu.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Game over screen when user loses   | UI   | When a player runs out of guesses or crossword is auto-solved, a Game Over screen is displayed.                                                                                                        | When the player runs out of guesses or auto-solves the crossword, the Game Over screen appears with final game state and option to return to main menu.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Start new game                     | UX   | Player can start a new game from the main menu.                                                                                                                                                        | When user clicks "New Game" button in main menu, a new crossword game starts with fresh grid being rendered on screen and clues being displayed.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Random words for crossword         | Sys  | The game uses a set of random words from different topics for the crossword generation.                                                                                                                | Each new game generates a unique crossword puzzle using randomly selected words from predefined word list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Scoring system                     | Sys  | Player scores points when correct word is guessed. The number of points scored equals to the count of letters in a correctly guessed word multiplied by 10.                                            | When player guesses a word correctly, score increases by number of points which equals the count of letters in the guesses word multiplied by 10. Example: guess word is TRAIN so player's score is bumped by 50 points.                                                                                                                       |
| Scoring system                     | Sys  | Player scores penalty points when auto-solves a clue. The number of points subtracted equals to the count of letters in a correctly guessed word multiplied by 10.                                     | When player auto-solves a clue, score is decreased by number of points which equals the count of letters in the word multiplied by 10. Example: guess word is APPLE so player's score is reduced by 50 points.                                                                                                                                 |
| Scoring system                     | Sys  | Player scores penalty points when auto-solves the entire crossword. The number of points subtracted equals to the count of letters in all unsolved words which have been auto-solved multiplied by 10. | When player auto-solves the entire crossword, score is decreased by number of points which equals to the total count of letters in all auto-solved words multiplied by 10. Example: user had two words 'GOLD' and 'IRON' still hidden and clicked 'Auto-solve' button so player's total score for the game is reduced by (4+4)*10 = 80 points. |

## Task 9 - Identify and rank potential risks to the project‚Äôs success 

During the brainstorming session, we identified the following potential risks to the project's success along with their mitigation strategies:

| Category                                      | Description                                                    | Mitigtion Strategy                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Lack of Coding Knowledge                      | Some people in this project may have different coding experience | Pair programming, online tutorials, team knowledge sharing.                                                                                                   |
| Dependencies on libraries                     | The project requires API for making the game more unique and random. If not, then it will be set values. Which may cause the user to become bored. | Create backend which will offer REST API and perform the overall heavy lifting of the game maintining game states, handling users, generating crosswords etc. |
| Presence of bugs which affect user experience | No amount of testing can make sure the final product will be bug free. Some things might be overlooked. | Thorough testing, user feedback loops, quick bug fixing cycles.                                                                                               |
| Scope creep                             | The project may become too big to handle for the three of us if we keep adding more and more features to the scope. | Mitigation: The scope should be frozen to MVP features only to ensure it can be delievered by the deadline.                                                   |

## Task 10 - Software development strategy 

We compared three software development strategies Waterfall, Agile and Rapid Application Development (RAD) as the main three candidates to select from a software development strategy for our project.

### Comparison of the three strategies

| Criteria                 | Waterfall                        | Agile                               | Rapid Application Development (RAD)   |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Flexibility              | Low - rigid phases               | High - iterative and adaptive       | High - iterative protyping            |
| Speed of Delivery        | Slow - sequential phases         | Fast - frequent releases            | Very Fast - rapid prototyping         |
| User Involvement         | Low - mainly at start and end    | High - continuous feedback          | Very High - constant user feedback    |
| Documentation            | Extensive upfront documentation  | Minimal - just enough               | Minimal - focus on working prototypes |
| Risk Management          | High risk if requirements change | Low risk through constant feedback  | Low risk due to adaptability          |  
| Team Size Suitability    | Large teams                      | Small to medium teams               | Small teams                           |
| Project Size Suitability | Large projects                   | Medium projects                     | Small projects                        |
| Outcome Focus            | Deliver complete product at end  | Deliver working software frequently | Deliver working prototypes quickly    |

### Reasons for choosing RAD for our project

After careful consideration we've decided to go with RAD software development strategy for our project because of the following reasons:
1. Time sensitivity as the delivery has to happen by 3rd of Nov so the turnaround should be really fast to deliver the project.
2. Requires speed of delivery and flexibility which RAD perfectly provides.
3. Minimise upfront planning so we don‚Äôt need waterfall with its rigid planning and significant planning overhead.
4. Process-wise: we aim to hit the ground running by prototyping features, testing them by users, getting feedback and iterating fast.
5. In the first half of the project minimal documentation while fast prototyping. In the second half when things start to settle, spend time on documenting them to have everything documented by the submission deadline.
6. Risks are reduced through the constant user feedback so that pivoting can happen after each prototype. 
7. RAD works great for small teams and our team is small so RAD fits very well.
8. RAD also works well for teams with mixed experience levels as the more experienced members can help the less experienced ones.
9. RAD is good for small projects and our project is small in scope and also has to happen within a short span of time.
10. Outcome focus: deliver working prototype quickly and then iterate fast to implement all MVP features so that the game crystalises into its final version to be submitted.

## Task 11 - Overall Test Plan

### Overall test strategy

The overall test strategy for the Crossword game involves a combination of manual testing and automated unit tests to ensure the game functions correctly and meets user requirements.
Such combination of manual functional testing and unit tests covering the code allows us to achieve high quality of the software being developed such as our crossword game.

#### Manual Testing

Manual tests are going to be done on the frontend to test the user interface and user experience.
For the manual testing a range of test cases will be created to cover all the main user flows and edge cases.
The manual tests will cover the following areas:
1. Game start and main menu navigation.
2. Crossword grid rendering and clue display.
3. Word guessing and answer validation.
4. Scoring system and HUD updates.
5. Hint and auto-solve functionality.
6. Game win and game over screens.
7. User account creation and login.

The detailed manual test cases will be documented as part of the Activity 4 below.

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests are done on the backend to test the REST API endpoints, game logic, scoring etc.
pytest framework is used for unit testing of the backend part.
In the backend folder, run the following command to execute the unit tests:
python -m pytest tests/test_app.py

## Task 1 - Refining and improving 

Task 1 ‚Äì Refining and Improving

After reviewing our initial specifications from Activity 1, the team met to refine the scope and simplify certain elements to make sure the crossword game could be fully developed within the time limit.

Improvements and Adjustments

| Area | Original Idea | Issue Identified | Improvement Implemented |
|------|----------------|------------------|--------------------------|
| Difficulty Levels | Multiple difficulty levels (easy/medium/hard) | Too time-consuming to design and test within project timeline | Reduced to a single default level for the first release |
| Timer Feature | Optional countdown and stopwatch | Not essential for gameplay; risked extra bugs | Removed timer for version 1.0, may add later |
| Scoring System | Combo/streak bonuses and advanced logic | Over-complicated for MVP | Simplified to +10 points for correct answers and ‚àí2 for hints |
| Hint Mechanism | Reveal entire word | Too generous; reduced challenge | Now reveals only one letter per click with a score penalty |
| UI / UX Design | Basic black-and-white layout | Hard to identify selected cells | Added blue highlight for active word and responsive font scaling |
| Backend Logic | Dynamic crossword generator via API | Not achievable in short timeframe | Using pre-defined word sets stored in JSON for reliability |
| Accessibility | Minimal colour contrast only | Needed better readability and accessibility | Added larger-text option and ensured high contrast ratio |
| Testing Plan | Only three manual tests | Limited coverage of key functions | Added more tests for hint button, win screen, and grid reset |

These refinements make the project **more achievable, user-friendly, and stable**, aligning with the RAD (Rapid Application Development) approach that emphasises quick prototyping, continuous testing, and iterative improvement.


## Task 2 - agree project requirements and specifications

After refining our ideas, the team agreed on the final set of requirements that are realistic to deliver within the deadline.  
The focus is on simplicity, functionality, and a smooth user experience.

#### Final Functional Specifications
1. Single-topic crossword with 6‚Äì8 words per puzzle.  
2. Player inputs answers manually and clicks **Check** to validate.  
3. **Hint** button reveals one letter and deducts points.  
4. Simple scoring system (+10 for correct, ‚àí2 for hint).  
5. Responsive UI with highlighted active word.  
6. **You Win** message appears when all words are completed.  
7. Local storage saves current progress.

#### Final Non-Functional Specifications
- Loads within 3 seconds.  
- Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.  
- Clear visual feedback (green = correct, red = incorrect).  
- High-contrast colours and readable fonts.  
- Modular code using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSON.  
- Hosted on GitHub Pages for easy access and testing.

These requirements ensure the game remains achievable while maintaining a polished and accessible user experience.

  DISPLAY main menu

  IF user clicks "Start"
      LOAD crossword grid
      DISPLAY clues and input area
      SET score = 0
      SET wordsSolved = 0

      WHILE game not finished
          WAIT for player input

          IF input matches correct word
              UPDATE grid with correct letters
              DISPLAY "Correct!"
              INCREASE score by 10
              INCREASE wordsSolved by 1
          ELSE
              DISPLAY "Incorrect!"

          IF player clicks "Hint"
              REVEAL one letter in selected word
              DECREASE score by 2

          IF wordsSolved == totalWords
              DISPLAY "You Win!" message
              EXIT LOOP
          END IF
      END WHILE

      SAVE progress locally
      DISPLAY final score
  END IF

END GAME
```



## Task 4 - UML Flowchart

 ## Task 5 - Game State management

This section defines how the game manages and tracks different states such as **Start**, **Win**, **Lose**, and **Draw**, as well as how these states are detected and updated during gameplay.

#### Game States
1. **Start State** ‚Äì The game begins when the player clicks the **Start** button on the main menu.  
   - The crossword grid, score, and clue list are loaded.  
   - Score and wordsSolved counters are set to zero.

2. **Active State** ‚Äì The player is actively entering answers and interacting with the crossword grid.  
   - Input is checked against the correct word list.  
   - Hints can be requested at the cost of points.

3. **Win State** ‚Äì Triggered when all words are correctly solved.  
   - A **‚ÄúYou Win!‚Äù** message is displayed.  
   - The final score is shown and stored locally.

4. **Lose State** ‚Äì (Optional) Activated if a time limit is implemented in later versions.  
   - The player loses if the time runs out before solving all words.

5. **Draw State** ‚Äì (For future multiplayer implementation)  
   - Triggered if both players find the same number of words when time expires.

#### Game Logic Overview
- **Check Word Function:**  
  - Compares the player‚Äôs input with the stored correct words.  
  - If the word matches ‚Üí display *‚ÄúCorrect!‚Äù*, reveal it in the grid, and award +10 points.  
  - If the word does not match ‚Üí display *‚ÄúIncorrect!‚Äù* and no points are given.

- **Hint Function:**  
  - Reveals one random unrevealed letter from the selected word.  
  - Deducts 2 points from the player‚Äôs score.  
  - Hints limited to showing 3 letters per word.

#### Win / Lose Conditions

**Single Player Mode:**  
- **Win:** All words are correctly solved.  
- **Lose:** (If a timer is added) Time expires before all words are found.

**Multiplayer Mode (Future):**  
- **Win:** Player finds more words than opponent before the time runs out.  
- **Lose:** Opponent finds more words before the timer ends.  
- **Draw:** Both players solve an equal number of words.

---

This design ensures that game states are **clearly defined, easily monitored, and scalable**, allowing smooth future integration of multiplayer and timed challenges.

## Architecture Design

Here goes the architecture design of the project (Alex).

We are using a client-server architecture.
We are going to have a backend server (controller) which will handle the game logic, scoring, leaderboard etc.
The backend will expose a RESTful API which the frontend (view) will call to start new game, get game state, submit guesses, get leaderboard etc.
The frontend will be a web app which will render the gameboard, clues, HUD etc.
The frontend will call the backend API to get game state, submit guesses etc.
Initially the backend will use a set of json files to store the game data (words, clues etc.) but later we might move to a database if time permits.

ToDo: add a block diagram here (Alex).
