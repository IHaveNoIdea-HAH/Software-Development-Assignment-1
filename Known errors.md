# Known Errors:

## Failed to start

I have no idea why this happens. But sometimes when running the python file it causes this error to occur.

### Temporary Fix:

Running the program again and again until it works somehow fixes it. Not a permanent fix.


##Homepage fail to load

Probably something to do with the code
see if app>__init__.py
line 8 says

```
def create_app(current_folder):
    app = Flask(__name__)
    app.config.from_object('app.config.Config')
```
